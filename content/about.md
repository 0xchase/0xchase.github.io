Hello ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my about page.

I'm currently studying [machine learning](https://cmns.umd.edu/graduate/science-academy/machine-learning) as a graduate student at UMD, working in [computer security research](https://www.defense.gov/), and spending my free time [developing platforms](https://github.com/procedural-audio) for procedural and generative music.

A thread that runs through all my interests is my interest in what's fundamental. Can see this through foundations of physics, cybersecuriy (assembly programming), neuroscience and cogniive science, and economics, which I see as a rigorous social science.

My career focus on cybersecurity was foreshadowed by an interest in security very young. Interest in fundemenals like assembly. Interest in being clever.

Became interested in philosophy towards the beginning of college due to a confluence of factors including this talk on free will. Philosophy of religion. Eventually this matured into a focus on contemporary analytic philosophy. Dragged, against all my intuitions, to being a humean about causation and natural laws. Sympathetic to the mentaculus project. I like the rationalist and post-rationalist social movements. Sometimes called eliminative materialism, illusionism, but I just call the global workspace theory, good resources include [1, 2, 3]. Good blogs include SSC and Scott Aaronson.

First became interested in economics and finance after watching a PBS documentary on the 2008 financial crisis. Ended up reading several books on he subject which was a good way to learn the mechanics of how the financial system works. I had always known I'd be interested... since it's nerdy, but this kicked it off. This broadened into monetary policy due to federal reserve quantitative easing during COVID (see this documentary). Trade deficits, especially this book by Michael Pettis. I'm no economist but I follow podcasts and occationally read reports by brookings. Good talks by Larry Summers [1, 2, 3, 4]. Other good books on interest rates and other topics.
