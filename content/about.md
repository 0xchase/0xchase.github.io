Hello ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my about page.

I'm currently studying [machine learning](https://cmns.umd.edu/graduate/science-academy/machine-learning) as a graduate student at UMD, working in [computer security research](https://www.defense.gov/), and spending my free time [developing platforms](https://github.com/procedural-audio) for procedural and generative music. 

### Interests

The list of interests I've accumulated over the years has gotten fairly long. My level of expertise varies in each of these areas.

- **Computer Science**: Programming, compilers, machine learning, DSP
- **Physics**: Foundations of physics, space and time, statistical mechanics
- **Philosophy**: Epistemology, mind, metaphysics, modality, religion, language
