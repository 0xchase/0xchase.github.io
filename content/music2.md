I compose and produce original music that I release to YouTube, Spotify, Apple Music, and Bandcamp.
My style blends elements of the [neo-classical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassicism_(music)), [electronic ambient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_music), and [post-rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-rock) genres. The best way to support this work is to purchase one of my albums on Bandcamp and I'd be happy to hear your feedback over [email](/contact). My musical influences include Olafur Arnalds, Hania Rani, Tony Anderson, Max Richter, Jameson Nathan Jones, and Hans Zimmer.

<!--
**Biography**: My musical education began with classical piano lessons during primary school. My most formative experience was as a keyboardist at Southbrook Church as a teenager, where I learned to improvise, play by ear, and was introduced to production and sound design. In college, Terrapin Record Label, etc. 5 years of trial-and-error to find my "sound" and learn violin/guitar.

## Film Scores

Occasionally I will write music to film.

### Westworld Scoring Competition

Submission for a scoring competition run by HBO and Spitfire Audio. The competition was to write a score for this scene from Westworld Season 3; this was my submission.

### Behold, The King is Coming

This is a score I wrote for a video produced by Southbrook Church. The version below excludes the narration so the score is more audible.
