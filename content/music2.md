I compose and produce a hybrid of neo-classical, electronic ambient, and post-rock music. I release music on Bandcamp, Spotify, and Apple Music via the Symphonia distributer..

Write some longish bio about how I became interested in music, how this developed, and more information about what I'm interested in and where I see this work going as I continue to write more music. Say some about my troubles with writing the first album and what it took to overcome those limitations.

Piano. Started with cinematic music. Guitar and violin.

My musical influences include Olafur Arnalds, Max Richter, Tony Anderson, Jameson Nathan Jones, Explosions in the Sky, and Hans Zimmer.

### Westworld Scoring Competition

Submission for a scoring competition run by HBO and Spitfire Audio. The competition was to write a score for this scene from Westworld Season 3; this was my submission.

### Behold, The King is Coming

This is a score I wrote for a video produced by Southbrook Church. The version below excludes the narration so the score is more audible.
