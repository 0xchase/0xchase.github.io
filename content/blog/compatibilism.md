## Introduction

(create a variant of this essay that's a review of Robert Sapolsky's book, "why scientists need philosophers")
(he doesn't take naturalism all the way to the end)

While many factual questions remain unanswered, for most of these issues, there is a consensus about the higher-order and related meta-questions.

While many factual questions remain unanswered, for most of these questions there is a general consensus about what would resolve them.

 - Many problems it’s clear when they’re resolved
   - Like in math or biology
   - For most problems in the sciences, it’s clear what would constitute an answer
   - Even if there’s not agreement, people generally agree on what a solution would look like
   - Expected that when the right solution surfaces, people will come to agree on it
   - Generally agreed what counts as evidence for and against the proposition
   - It’s clear what constitute an answer
   - What would resolve the debate is generally agreed upon

###  Free will isn’t like this

The question of whether humans have free will is not like this. Like many questions that have been left for philosophers, the points of contention include not only the question itself, but also the meaning and nature of all the concepts presupposed by the question. And though it takes the form of a factual question, there’s not a consensus about what empirical results are relevant to resolving it, nor what the various candidates demonstrate. People with mutually contradictory positions have high confidence in their views, and even people who nominally share a stance often still disagree about the *reasons* that view is correct. These layers of confusion no-doubt explain why this issue remains fraught after centuries of debate.

### What I’ll cover

I’m going to offer my perspective on the free will debate, with a particular focus on why it seems intractable, what explains people’s conflicting intuitions about the issue, and the foundational reasons people continue to disagree and talk past each other.

In the end I will conclude that compatibilism is correct, and that much opposition to it arises from a failure to repudiate our pre-scientific "folk" theory of mind and a failure take naturalism to its final conclusion.

Arises from the stranglehold our pre-scientific "folk" theory of mind has on our intuitions.
A failure to extend naturalism to our own minds.
I'll attempt to show how the stranglehold this theory has over our intuitions explains both a variety of common and demonstrably false misconceptions, and show how repudiating this theory significanly clears up the debate.

The right way to *reason* about the debate, so as to resolve it in principal.

I'm not going to jump to the right 

My intention is to walk the reader through my own thinking about free will, and why I eventually landed as a compatibilist.

However, I don’t think one can fully understand this issue by jumping to the final conclusion, so I intend to walk the reader through the landscape of views, successively showing the confusions implicit in the previous view. In explaining the alternative views I'll sometimes repeat assertions I think are *false* or based on common *misconceptions*, which we'll clear up as we go along.

<explain possible positions>

The primary contribution of this essay is to the compatibilism/incompatibilism debate. I'll briefly cover why determinism must be true in order to modivate and contextualize the rest of my discussion, but I won't be saying anything novel about it - I consider it to be basically a closed matter and libertariaism to be a dead position, so my attention will be focused elsewhere.

## Determinism

(harris talk as a reference)

One of the most profound shifts brought about by the scientific revolution has been the replacement of teleological explanations with *mechanistic* ones. The dominant pre-scientific theory of nature concieved of objects as having inherent powers like X, Y, and Z, and inherent purposes like A, B, and C. The sciences replaced this approach with the practice of writing down mathematical *laws of nature*, that could be validated or falsified experimentally. Despite the fact that these laws were meachanical, soulless, and devoid of the intentionality humans so readily project onto th eexternal world, the superiority of this approach was demonstrated by the unparalled success of these laws at making empirical predictions, and the extraordinary success of the application of these theories to developing new technologies.

So perhaps the broadest conclusion to be taken from this revolution is that our world can be described by *laws of nature* - the most fundemental being the laws of physics. Though the final theory of physics hasn't yet been discovered, the laws we do know have be verified with extraordinary precision in particle accelerators - we know of no experimental violations of quantum field theory, and we have every reason to think these laws apply universally.

Naively, this fact poses a problem for human freedom because these laws seem to completely and inviolably determine how the world evolves over time. Given some initial conditions, in principal one could apply these laws to exactly predict future events, without making any reference to human intentions, decision, or actions. One might wonder what room is left for human decisions or actions to change the inexorable mechanistic evolution of the world towards the singular future that has been predetermined since the big bang.

Furthermore, we have every reason to think that these mechanisms apply not only to inert objects like particles, rocks, and celestial bodies, but to our brains and decision-making processes themselves. After all, our brains are composed of neurons, our neurons are composed of cells, and these cells are composed of fundemental particles. Even without considering this reduction, we have fairly accurate differential models of neurons and little reason to think that any stochastic deviation from these models has anything to do with a magic decision making substance.

The more we learn about how the brain works, the more we begin to seem like mechanical devices just like toy robots, just like computer programs. We just operate on neurons instead of transistors. Not that this different matters, because our neurons can be *simulated* with transitors. Is there any metaphysical barrier to simulating our brains on a computer?

At the level of genes + environment

Furthermore, consider simply introspecting. Words just come to you. How many of our decision are even conscious? This point is driven home by the libet experiments, which show researchers can predict your actions before you're even consciously aware of it.

Indeterminism objection, is irrelevant. Dice isn't a decision. The problem wasn't determinism exactly, it's that our decisions are law-like at all.

And now we're ready to see, that though the sciences provided a powerful validation of this picture, our central conclusion can be arrived at a-priori. Two options: determinism and indeterminism. We happen to have good reason to think our world evolves deterministically, but even if we didn't, this simple binary would still apply. Neither is good for human freedom. What other options are there? Even if we introduce a magic substance. The same problem applies. The problem for human freedom is essentially a logical matter. Even in an invented world. Not only does freedom not exist in our world, it's impossible to conieve of a world where we would be free.

### Incompatibilism

The image of ourselves and the world as a kind of mechanical device is difficult to reconcile with our intuitive conception of ourselves as free agents. The future is fixed by the past. The decision you'll make are fixed by the past. The factors that influence your decisions are beyond your control, and it's impossible as a logical matter to even *concieve* of a world where such a freedom would be possible. This difficulty has led many to accept *incompatibilism* - the view that determinism and free will are incompatible. While this incompatibility has led a few to reject determinism, the vast majority accept the arguments for determinism and conclude that *there is no free will*.

I hope I've painted the arguments for determinism in a sufficiently compelling light, and I hope you feel the intuitive pull of this perspective even if you didn't before. We'll eventually see how the entire narrative above is laden with subtle confusions, but first we'll need to take a detour into some of the foundational issues that underly this issue, and briefly examine *how* to htink about this debate.

## Definitions

Like many perennial problems in philosophy, the issue of free will is one where disagreement about the meanings of the key terms is a central issue. While the above picture *seems* to threatning to human freedom, it's going to depend on exactly how we define it. Some definitions offered by philosophers are compatible with determinism. To some extent this is a semantic issue - some concepts of free will are incompatible with determinism and therefore unreal, and some weaker concepts of free will are compatible with determinism and real, and that's all that can be said. But surely how people normally conceptialize their own freedom matters?

Can we write down a definition of free will as most people understand it? Doing this is surprisingly difficult. Many have tried, but there's no concensus around one definition, or even that there *is* a coherent concept of freedom to give a definition of. Here's a few canidates.

 - Definition 1
 - Definition 2
 - Definition 3
 - Definition 4

Some of these definitions (like 1 and 2) are taken to be incompatible with determinism. Some definitions (like 3 and 4) are taken to compatible with determinism. Some are disputed. Hard determinists will likely have one of the first definitions in mind, and compatibilists will likely have one of the latter ones. Given that they may concieve of the debate in different ways, is there any reason to say one of them is *right* and the other *wrong*? Or is this only an issue of semantics?

### Aristotelian Chemistry

I’d like to suggest a general strategy for resolving disagreements about definitions, but first we need to examine the concept of a definition itself. Most importantly, there’s a distinction between *intensional* and *extensional* definitions. An intensional definition specifies the meaning of a term using necessary and sufficient conditions, or in other words, listing the properties an object needs to have in order to be counted as a referent of the term. For example, you might say that to be a “bachelor” is to be “unmarried” and a “man”. This is in contrast to the extensional definition, which is given using a list of all the objects that satisfy the definition. So an extensional definition of a bachelor would be the list “Bob”, “Ike”, “Jim” and all the other bachelors. Another way to put this is that the intension of a term gives it's *meaning*, while the extension of a term gives its *referant*.

(maybe change this example to not introduce the chemist until the end)

Let’s apply this to help us understand a simple disagreement. This may seem like a tangent but I promise it it provides a powerful analogy to the free will debate and it will help us clarify the issue significantly. Imagine that an Aristotelian physicist meets with a modern-day chemist to debate the nature of water. The former believes that water is one of the four elements that compose the terrestrial sphere…

<Table comparing their beliefs, or just listing the aristotelian's beliefs>

They both believe water is liquid, and blue, and drinkble, but one says water is H2O and the other says it's a fundemental element of nature. They agree on all the instances of water - that it's in the cup, that it's in the lake and ocean, etc. So they agree about the *extension* of water but they disagree about the *intension* of water.  Another way of saying this is that they agree on the *referent* of water, but just not what water *is*.

This shows that the reference of a term can systematically deviate from the underlying concept. I don't claim to provide a full theory of reference here, but...

How would verify/analyze claims? One tempting account is to give a definition in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions, and to look for something that satisfies that concept. While this approach is natural, it is clearly wrong. If this was the right way to analyze the claims, then it would be *false*, that water is blue, that water is a liquid, and so on, because there does not exist a fundemental element with these properties. The right way to analyze the claim is instead to look at the referent of the claim, or the extension of the term.

Now if the aristotelian does an experiment and learns that water is *H2O*, how should they revise their beliefs? They need only change their belief about the *intension* of water. They should not then conclude that water doesn't exist, or that it's not blue, so on and so forth.

So modern chemistry should lead us to revise our concept of water. We should not conclude water doesn't exist, or that our other beliefs about it were false. This is because in deciding if something is real what matters is the *referent* of the term.

(could cache all this out in terms of predicate logic)
(predicate logic of extensions and definitions)

Note that this doesn't mean concepts are always real. Take the case of the luminous ether, or race. Neither of these concepts has a referrant. It is false that the either has X, Y, Z properties, there is no fundemental distinction between groups... etc. Ether doesn't refer to anything. Unicorn doesn't refer to anything (in the world). So in deciding if something is real, what matters is whether our usage refers to something.

### Free Will

I will argue that the situation with the aristotelian chemist is close analogue of the free will debate, except instead of the problematic concept being a pre-scientific theory of nature, it's a pre-scientific theory of mind – that is, the commonsense but false way that people concieve of their own minds, the minds of others, and how these minds relate to the world.

When deciding if a concept like freedom is real, it’s tempting to start with an intensional, and to look for anything in the world that satisfies the specified conditions. The case of the Aristotelian physicist shows that this is not always the right strategy, and that in deciding whether free will is *real*, we should look at the *referent* of the term to see if it refers to something.

## Folk Psychology

### Folk Psychology

When I say that part of the problem is a pre-scientific theory of mind, I'm referring to what psychologists and philosophers have often called "folk psychology".

 - Folk theory of the world
   - Here’s a rough sketch of how this theory works
   - First, a simple binary, there’s the self vs. the external word
   - The external world is filled with objects and agents
   - Note that this division isn’t real as a fundamental ontological category, they’re just a way we model the world
   - Our minds categorize the world into the subjective, objective, etc. It does not follow that the world actually is this way.
   - A failure to recognize that this division is a matter of how we represent the world, has led to many confusions in the history of philosophy
   - Has led to the reification of the mental as a fundamental ontological category, like the idealists who debate whether the composition of the world is mental or not

 Here’s a rough sketch of the theory. First, there’s a simple division between the self, which is populated with thoughts, feelings, sensations, etc, and the external world, which is populated with objects. These objects may be classified according to their properties, and one of the most important classes is that of agents.

The behavior of agents have various propositional attitudes, like the states of belief, desire, and intention, attitudes which may also apply to the self.

Self has indirect access to the world through senses

It’s important to note that this theory is only a description of how our minds *represent* the world, not an account of how the world actually is. 

### Wrong

Despite its common sense appeal, every proposal in the above theory is subtly mistaken.

There isn’t a fundamental division between self and the external world. There is just the world. Science has given us good reason to think our minds are our brains, and that are brains are natural objects like any other. It's all just continuous matter. There is a fundemental distinction in how we *concieve* of the self and world, and we might do that for good *reason*, but that's a matter of representation (or a category of thought), not a matter of how the world actually is. The reification of these concepts as fundamental ontological categories has led to many confusions in the history of philosophy, like idealism and substance dualism, and the difficulty of seeing beyond this perspective has led to meaningless debates about topics like whether the world is fundamentally physical or mental. Many of these distinctions are so foundational to how we think, that it can be difficult to see outside of them or how they might lead us astray, which they often do.

We aren't outside of the world, intervening in it. We're a part of the world.

 - Similarly this is how we model our own minds, and it may not correspond to how our minds actually function
 - Minds are a complex messy collection of neural nets. There’s unlikely to be a list of “beliefs” or “desires” or “intentions” to be found anywhere, etc
 - May not be a brain state that corresponds to a propositional attitude. We model their behavior by ascribing this property because it predicts their behavior. Intention is a good example

I’m not arguing that our folk theory of mind should be thrown out (a la the Churchlands). Similar to how Newtonian mechanics is a great approximation of the dynamics of material objects, the folk theory of mind is actually a pretty good way to model our minds most of the time. It’s actually quite amazing how effectively a list of propositional attitudes can be used to model/predict the behavior of a complex brain consisting of 100 billion neurons. That being said, this theory does gloss over many subtleties of our psychology, and the free will debate is one where these subtleties matter.

The aspect of our theory of mind we’re concern about here is our theory of the will, which is capable of motivating actions

### Decisions

 - One aspect of this theory is our theory of the will
 - The will is capable of causing actions through the act of willing
 - One of these propositional attitudes is that of willing
 - If someone is willing something, then they will act in a way so as to bring about that proposition
 - Furthermore, we make the distinction between acts that are willed freely, and those that aren’t

### Free Will

 - Elaborate on the theory
 - Difference between free decisions and unfree decisions
 - Difference between willing freely and willing un-freely
 - World behaves in a certain way
 - We intervene in the world on the basis of our decisions

### Essense of the debate 1

 - So this is the essence of the debate
 - We have a folk psychological theory of how the mind works
 - With the corresponding concept of human freedom
 - Various aspects of this theory are incompatible with various facts of science
 - Science is presenting us with an orthogonal theory of how the mind works
 - It’s unclear if the folk theory can be reduced to the neuroscientific one
 - Several positions
      - Determinism, compatibilism, etc

## Mixing scince and folk psychology

The confusions start to set in when we mix this naive theory of how our minds work with other facts established by science. We'll see how these confusions are widespread.

The manifest image is hard to throw off. These problemeatic concepts are fundemental to our cognition.

### Confusion 1: Fatalism

Comes from thinking of mind as separate entities that intervene in the external world.

 - This way of thinking is fundemental to causal reasoning, which is about intervention
 - What happens when you combine the folk theory of mind with the fact of determinism? You get fatalism.
 - This confusion comes from imagining your mind as somehow separate from the world, and interevening in it
 - If world is causally closed, your decisions don't matter. You can't change anything.
 - Mind is separate from the world, if the world is causally closed, your decisions don’t matter
 - No one doubts determinism in the context of science, or on the basis of science. They only doubt it after it seems to conflict with their experience.
 - The fact that the truth/falsity of determinism has been central to the free will debate shows the confusion
 - Give examples of confused redditors

### Confusion 2: Decisions fixed by past causes

Comes from the humonculous fallacy. From thinking I am somehow separate from my brain.

 - Okay. So we need to fix our theory of mind a bit. Our minds are part of the world.
 - Decisions have been fixed since the big bang
 - People somehow think physics *forces* you to make a decision, somehow.
 - Mindless particles somehow make you do certain things.
 - So our actions *are* caused by reasons. It's just that our reasoning is another physical process.
 - Give examples of confused redditors, professors, Sapolsky
 - Even the language of the past "influencing" our decisions shows this confusion

### Confusion 3: Couldn't do otherwise

 - <maybe the same as confusion 2>
 - Rewind time, you would always make the same decision, so you couldn't do otherwise.
 - This is not correct, it's actually that you *wouldn't* do otherwise.
 - Couldn't meants *if* you had chosen, then you would do that thing
 - Wouldn't means you wouldn't ever choose
 - If you wouldn't, does this mean you are somehow constrained or forced by your environment?
 - In fact, if you failed to choose it, if it was random, *that* would be a threat to your freedom
 - You choose ice cream because you really prefer one. Of course you would always choose it. If you didn't, or made the decision on the basis of something else other than your preferences, *that* would be a threat to your freedom
 - If you chose at gunpoint, you're unfree. This is because you aren't aligning your decisions and desires.
 - At gunpoint, you can no longer choose to live and eat preferred ice cream. You are one optoin less free.
 - So you never *would* choose. Even though you certainly *could* choose.
 - Give examples of confused redditors, professors, Sapolsky
 - Note that it's precesely *because* our reasons determine our actions, that we *wouldn't* do otherwise
 - And it's precisely *because* our reasons determine our actions, that we *could* do otherwise if we had different reasons

### Confusion 4: ???

 - Would be nice to have a 4th confusion.
 - Maybe emergence related? Mindless atoms detemining decisions? Dawkins quite about no good, no evil, only... Or a quote from Alex that hard-nosed eliminativist.
 - Comment on Sapolsky wondering how there must be one neuron that acts independently of prior determining causes, forgets that the past events don’t fully determine it. What determines it is the combination of past events and its nature. Similarly our reasons our *in our nature*.
 - Comment on people saying you must "act like free will exists"
 - Comment on people saying the "experience of freedom is real"

## Reconciling the scientific and the manifest image

### Essense of the debate 2

 - So this is the essence of the debate
 - We have a folk psychological theory of how the mind works
 - With the corresponding concept of human freedom
 - Various aspects of this theory are incompatible with various facts of science
 - Science is presenting us with an orthogonal theory of how the mind works
 - It’s unclear if the folk theory can be reduced to the neuroscientific one
 - Several positions
      - Determinism, compatibilism, etc

### A theory of decisions

 - Matter of deliboration
 - A physical process like any other
 - Same way a computer has certain processes
 - We should revise our theory of decisions because of referent

### A theory of freedom

 - If naturalism is taken all the way.
 - Our decisions do matter.
 - They are physical process just like any other, but they do cause future events.
 - Our desires are essential part of determining the future, just like the big bang was.
 - It's true that *who we are* was formed by are past
   - But that doesn't mean we don't make decisions
   - It doesn't mean our decision are less free
   - It doesn't mean our *reasons* don't determine our actions
 - We should revise our theory of decisions because of referrent

Does this refer to a real distinction in the world? Well consider the following cases: something, something, something.

## Conclusion

So on this basis I've accepted compatibilism and concluded that free will does exist. Perhaps we need to revise how we concieve of our own minds, but science has already made us do this for every other pre-scientific concept. I'm somewhat skeptical, that this new concept of freedom will support a robust conception of moral responsibility, for example, though I'm not sure that the original concept does either.

I've attempted to show that many of the intuitions that drive the common view that free will and determinism are incompatible come from a failure to replace our pre-scientific theory of mind with a naturalist one. I find this somewhat ironic because the hard determinists often think of themselves as the ones who the most committed to science, while I'm arguing many of them are unknowingly seeing this issue through the lens of a prescientific theory of mind.

The fact that determinism has been so central to the free will debate tells us less about free will and more about the stranglehold our intuitive psychology and innate concepts has over us.
