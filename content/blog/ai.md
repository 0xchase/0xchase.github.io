## Notes

- Building new capacities into these machines is hard-won
- Language models must understand our values
- People make an analogy between us and dogs and ai and us
  - This analogy is limited
  - Human reasoning is modelled by predicate logic
  - Predicate logic can model all other kinds
  - So our intelligence can generalize to understand anything else
- There's a limit to the summit of useful intelligence
  - Larger representations of the world have diminishing returns
  - The main advantage is C
