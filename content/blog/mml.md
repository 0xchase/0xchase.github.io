## Introduction

These are my solutions for the problem sets from the textbook [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/).

---

## Part 1: Mathematical Foundations

### Chapter 2: Linear Algebra

Here is an inline equation $x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}$ using the dollar signs.

This is an equation shown on its own line.

$$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$
$$ y = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}} $$
$$ z = {-b^2-4ac} $$
