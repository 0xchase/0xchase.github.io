## Introduction

In the complex terrain of philosophical theories of truth, one theory stands out 

Different kinds of relaivism.

Cultural relativism is largely the perview of sophomoric college leftists, who see it as a form of cultural sensitivisty or inclusivness. Intellectual backbone, poststucturalist, constructed by language. Serious version ahve been relegated to english departments trying to do philosophy.

But the most compelling form of relativism has always been speaker relativism. 

My dear friend has become sympathetic to it. I will explain why I think he is confused.

Relativism in usually modivatd by epistemological skepticism.

Assertions express "truths", rather than beliefs, or in addition to beliefs.

**Note**: Get them to read the summary before I give my critique


## The Theory

There are different kinds of relativism, but for the moment we will be concerned with speaker relativism.

### Questions for the Relativist

How is your theory different from speaker relativism, if it is different?

- In your theory, is truth a property?
- In your theory, what are the truth bearers?
- In your theory, is there a difference between truth and belief?
- In your theory, are there any false assertions?
- In your theory, are there any false beliefs?
- In your theory, are there stance-independant facts?

- Is every assertion true? Or just the ones you believe? So if I assert something I don't believe, that isn't true?
- Should probably be a truth eliminativist
- Are there no false assertions?

It's just speaker relativism

## Story

### Intoductions

The sides tend to talk past each other, which I'm going to illustrate with a story taken from simon Blackburn's talk "Truth, Objectivity, and Rorty", or his book "Being Good".

> This is illustrated by a nice anecdote of a friend of mine. He was present at a high-powered ethics institute which had put on a forum in which representatives of the great religions held a panel debate. First the Buddhist talked of the ways to calm, the mastery of desire, the path of enlightenment, and the panellists all said, ‘Wow, terrific, if that works for you that’s great.’ Then the Hindu talked of the cycles of suffering and birth and rebirth, the teachings of Krishna and the way to release, and they all said, ‘Wow, terrific, if that works for you that’s great.’ And so on, until the Catholic priest talked of the message of Jesus Christ, the promise of salvation, and the way to life eternal, and they all said, ‘Wow, terrific, if that works for you that’s great.’ And he thumped the table and shouted, ‘No! It’s not a question of if it works for me! It’s the true word of the living God, and if you don’t believe it you’re all damned to hell!’

> And they all said, ‘Wow, terrific, if that works for you that’s great.’

> The joke here lies in the mismatch between what the priest intends
– a claim to unique authority and truth – and what he is heard as
offering, which is a particular avowal, satisfying to him, but only to be tolerated or patronized, like any other. The moral is that once a relativist frame of mind is really in place, nothing – no claims to truth, authority, certainty, or necessity – will be audible except as one more saying like all the others. Of course that person talks of certainty and truth, says the relativist. That’s just his certainty and truth, made absolute for him, which means no more than ‘made into a fetish’.

As Blackburn says, you can give something with the right hand and yet it is recieved with the left.

## Analysis

### General

- Overlap between assertions and truth claims is explained by the *belief norm*
- Are there no mind-independant mathematical truths? Physical truths?
- It makes the same mistake as the other theories of truth. Some assertions are indexical (e.g. I have blue eyes), not it's not fundemental to what truth is.
- There is no stance independant fact about the truth of X hypothesis in mathematics

### What a theory of truth should do

- Provide a reasonable interpretation of ordinary language statements
- Support truth generalizations
- Support normative aspects of truth (aim of inquiry, etc)
- Fit into a broader theory of assertions, meanings, beliefs, etc
- Be precise enough for mathematics (set theory, logic)
- Be robust enough for science

### Counterexamples

- On this theory, there are no false assertions
- "It's true for you and it's true for me" is implicitly a non-relativistic assertion
- Are truth and beleif defined circularlly on one another?
