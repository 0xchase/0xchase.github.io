## Introduction

In the complex terrain of philosophical theories of truth, one theory stands out 

Different kinds of relaivism.

Cultural relativism is largely the perview of sophomoric college leftists, who see it as a form of cultural sensitivisty or inclusivness. Intellectual backbone, poststucturalist, constructed by language. Serious version ahve been relegated to english departments trying to do philosophy.

But the most compelling form of relativism has always been speaker relativism. 

My dear friend has become sympathetic to it. I will explain why I think he is confused.

Relativism in usually modivatd by epistemological skepticism.

Assertions express "truths", rather than beliefs, or in addition to beliefs.

**Note**: Get them to read the summary before I give my critique

## The Theory

### Questions

- Is there any difference between truth and belief on this theory?
  - Is the truth bearer assertions? Sentences? Propositions? Mental states?
- Are there any false assertions?
- Are there any false beliefs?
- "It's true for you and it's true for me" is implicitly a non-relativistic assertion
- There is no stance independant fact about the truth of X hypothesis in mathematics

It's just speaker relativism

## Analysis

### General

- Overlap between assertions and truth claims is explained by the *belief norm*
- Are there no mind-independant mathematical truths? Physical truths?

### Counterexamples

- On this theory, there are no false assertions
