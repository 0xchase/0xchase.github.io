### Theory

How you use the word truth is determined by your web of beliefs
Therefore truth is belief dependent

Should read plato stanford pragmatism

### Problems
- This theory is actually subjectivism, not pragmatism
- In this theory, a belief and a truth are the same.
- In this theory, assertions express truths. This is wrong, they express a belief.
