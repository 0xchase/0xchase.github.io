## Film Scoring

### Westworld Scoring Competition

Submission for a scoring competition run by HBO and Spitfire Audio. The competition was to write a score for this scene from Westworld Season 3; this was my submission.

This is a score I wrote for a video produced by Southbrook Church. The version below excludes the narration so the score is more audible.
