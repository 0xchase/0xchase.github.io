## Presentations

### Audio Developer Conference 2022

**Abstract**: Piracy remains a ubiquitous and persistent problem for audio developers attempting to commercialize their products. This is in part because most custom license checking schemes contain fairly basic mistakes that make it easy for crackers to bypass them. This presentation unveils tricks and techniques commonly used by crackers and explains how they can be made more resistant to common attacks.

### Radare2 Conference 2020

**Abstract**: This talk is an overview the new "Modality" radare2 plugin to perform symbolic execution. The tool is built on top of angr, and provides a faster alternative to using angr than writing scripts. This integration has numerous advantages, including easy switching between concrete and symbolic execution, useful visualizations of the angr backend, as well as a suite of features for vulnerability detection and exploit generation.

## Other

### UMD Philosophy Club - President

I was president of the UMD philosophy club for 2 years. We had weekly meetings covering topics in philosophy and bi-weekly socials. This experience significantly improved my ability to think methodically, reason clearly, form cogent arguments, lead group discussions, and foster substantive conversations.
