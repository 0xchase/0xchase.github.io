## Introduction

The question of whether humans have free will is not like this. Like many questions that have been left for philosophers, the points of contention include the meaning and nature of all the concepts presupposed by the question, and though it takes the form of a factual question, thereâ€™s not a consensus about what empirical results are relevant to resolving it, nor what the various candidates demonstrate. People with mutually contradictory positions have high confidence in their views, and even people who nominally agree on a stance often still disagree about the reasons that view is correct. These layers of confusion no-doubt explain why this issue remains fraught after centuries of debate.
