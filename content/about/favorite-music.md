This post attempts to provide a general outline and analysis of my music preferences. I write this post in part with the goal of figuring out if any traits unify the otherwise diverse genres I'm interested in, and I hope that anyone else who reads this find in it some new music they like.

## Pop

## Pop-Folk

## Downtempo Electronic

## Post-Rock

## Neo-Classical

## Chamber Strings

## Cinematic

## Ambient

Ambient music emphasizes tone and atmosphere over music structure or rhythm. Though there are many different kinds, my favorite ambient music is usually tonal and melodic with a sense of space (i.e lots of reverb). Some of my favorite ambient artists include [Tony Anderson](https://www.tonyandersonmusic.com/), [Jameson Nathan Jones](https://www.jamesonnathanjones.com/), and [Meydan](https://meydan.bandcamp.com/album/ambient-works-iii).
