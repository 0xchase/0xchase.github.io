<h2 id="interests">Interests</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of interests I&rsquo;ve accumulated over the years.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cybersecurity</strong>: Reverse engineering, binary exploitation, cryptography, symbolic execution</li>
<li><strong>Computer Science</strong>: Programming, compilers, machine learning, operating system internals</li>
<li><strong>Music Technology</strong>: Digital signal processing, modular synthesizers, plugin development</li>
<li><strong>Philosophy</strong>: Epistemology, mind, metaphysics, modality, religion, language, analytic philosophy</li>
<li><strong>Physics</strong>: Foundations of physics, space and time, statistical mechanics</li>
<li><strong>Cognitive Science</strong>: Mental representation, global workspace theory</li>
<li><strong>Economics</strong>: The great recession, monetary policy, trade imbalances</li>
<li><strong>Music</strong>: Piano, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, desktop synthesizers, pedalboards</li>
<li><strong>VFX</strong>: Unreal Engine 5, Blender 3D, Houdini (a little bit)</li>
</ul>

<p>My career focus on cybersecurity was foreshadowed by an interest in security very young. Interest in fundemenals like assembly. Interest in being clever.</p>
<p>Became interested in philosophy towards the beginning of college due to a confluence of factors including this talk on free will. Philosophy of religion. Eventually this matured into a focus on contemporary analytic philosophy. Dragged, against all my intuitions, to being a humean about causation and natural laws. Sympathetic to the mentaculus project. I like the rationalist and post-rationalist social movements. Sometimes called eliminative materialism, illusionism, but I just call the global workspace theory, good resources include [1, 2, 3]. Good blogs include SSC and Scott Aaronson.</p>
<p>First became interested in economics and finance after watching a PBS documentary on the 2008 financial crisis. Ended up reading several books on he subject which was a good way to learn the mechanics of how the financial system works. I had always known I&rsquo;d be interested&hellip; since it&rsquo;s nerdy, but this kicked it off. This broadened into monetary policy due to federal reserve quantitative easing during COVID (see this documentary). Trade deficits, especially this book by Michael Pettis. I&rsquo;m no economist but I follow podcasts and occationally read reports by brookings. Good talks by Larry Summers [1, 2, 3, 4]. Other good books on interest rates and other topics.</p>
