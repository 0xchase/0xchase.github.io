      <description>(create a variant of this essay that&amp;rsquo;s a review of Robert Sapolsky&amp;rsquo;s book, &amp;ldquo;why scientists need philosophers&amp;rdquo;) (he doesn&amp;rsquo;t take naturalism all the way to the end)&#xA;Introduction Like many disputes that have been left for philosophers, the question of whether humans have free will is particularlly fraught. The points of contention include not only the answer to the question itself, but also the meaning and nature of all the concepts presupposed by the question, and though it superficially takes the form of an empirical question about human psychology, it&amp;rsquo;s unclear if any experiment would resolve it, or even if empirical results are relevant evidence in principal.</description>

      <title>Writing Elegant DSP Code in Rust</title>

      <description>Introduction In this post Iâ€™m going to attempt to show some of the advantages the rust type system brings to writing more elegant DSP code. We&amp;rsquo;re going to start with a crash course on the relevant parts of the rust type system, and then we&amp;rsquo;ll see how this can be applied to constructing the types and traits that will be the foundation of a Rust audio processing library. We&amp;rsquo;ll then see how to apply some more abstract features of the Rust type system to make these elements more composable and modular.</description>

      <description>Context At one of the monthly meetings for my cohort at work, an inspirational speaker was invited to present on how to thrive in the workplace. Unfortunately, the presentation was laden with various forms of new-age pseudoscience. When several of us complained to the administrators who had organized the speech, we were told that the speaker had &amp;ldquo;evidence&amp;rdquo; to back up his claims, and that he was certified by an accredited university.</description>
