<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Like many disputes that have been left for philosophers, the question of whether humans have <em>free will</em> is particularlly fraught. The points of contention include not only the answer to the question itself, but also the meaning and nature of all the concepts presupposed by the question, and though it superficially takes the form of an empirical question about human psychology, it&rsquo;s unclear if any experiment would resolve it, or even if empirical results are relevant evidence in principal. These layers of confounds have created a landscape where people with mutually contradictory positions have high confidence in their views, and even people who nominally share a stance often still disagree about the <em>reasons</em> that view is correct. The issue remains fraught after centuries of debate.</p>
<h3 id="what-ill-cover">What I’ll cover</h3>
<p>I’m going to offer my perspective on the free will debate, with a particular focus on explaining why it seems intractable, what explains people’s conflicting intuitions about the issue, and the foundational reasons people continue to disagree and talk past each other.</p>
<p>In the end I will conclude that compatibilism is correct, and that the apparent incompatibliity between determinism and free will comes from misguided intutions people have about how their minds relate to the world due to the stranglhold our pre-scientific &ldquo;folk&rdquo; theory of mind has on our intuitions. I&rsquo;ll attempt to show that selectively repudiating the false aspects of this theory and extending the naturalistic project to cover own decision making processes clears up many demonstrably false misconceptions people have about the implications of determinism, and dissolves the apparent threat it poses to human freedom.</p>
<p>Given how fraught this debate is, this post will be substantially devoted to investigating the right way to <em>reason</em> about the debate, so as to resolve it in principal. I don’t think one can fully understand this issue by jumping to what I consider to be the correct view, so I intend to walk the reader through the landscape of perspectives, successively showing the confusions implicit in each one. In explaining the alternative views I&rsquo;ll sometimes repeat assertions I think are <em>false</em> or based on common <em>misconceptions</em>, which we&rsquo;ll clear up as we go along.</p>
<p>The primary contribution of this post is to the compatibilism/incompatibilism debate. I&rsquo;ll briefly cover why determinism must be true in order to modivate and contextualize the rest of my discussion, but I won&rsquo;t be saying anything particularlly novel about it - I consider it to be basically a closed matter and libertariaism to be a dead position, so my attention will be focused elsewhere.</p>
<h2 id="determinism">Determinism</h2>
<p>(harris talk as a reference)</p>
<p>One of the most profound shifts brought about by the scientific revolution has been the replacement of teleological explanations with <em>mechanistic</em> ones. The dominant pre-scientific theory of nature concieved of objects as having inherent powers like X, Y, and Z, and inherent purposes like A, B, and C. The sciences replaced this approach with the practice of writing down mathematical <em>laws of nature</em>, that could be validated or falsified experimentally. Despite the fact that these laws were meachanical, soulless, and devoid of the intentionality humans so readily project onto th eexternal world, the superiority of this approach was demonstrated by the unparalled success of these laws at making empirical predictions, and the extraordinary success of the application of these theories to developing new technologies.</p>
<p>So perhaps the broadest conclusion to be taken from this revolution is that our world can be described by <em>laws of nature</em> - the most fundemental being the laws of physics. Though the final theory of physics hasn&rsquo;t yet been discovered, the laws we do know have be verified with extraordinary precision in particle accelerators - we know of no experimental violations of quantum field theory, and we have every reason to think these laws apply universally.</p>
<p>Naively, this fact poses a problem for human freedom because these laws seem to completely and inviolably determine how the world evolves over time. Given some initial conditions, in principal one could apply these laws to exactly predict future events, without making any reference to human intentions, decision, or actions. One might wonder what room is left for human decisions or actions to change the inexorable mechanistic evolution of the world towards the singular future that has been predetermined since the big bang.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have every reason to think that these mechanisms apply not only to inert objects like particles, rocks, and celestial bodies, but to our brains and decision-making processes themselves. After all, our brains are composed of neurons, our neurons are composed of cells, and these cells are composed of fundemental particles. Even without considering this reduction, we have fairly accurate differential models of neurons and little reason to think that any stochastic deviation from these models has anything to do with a magic decision making substance.</p>
<p>The more we learn about how the brain works, the more we begin to seem like mechanical devices just like toy robots, just like computer programs. We just operate on neurons instead of transistors. Not that this different matters, because our neurons can be <em>simulated</em> with transitors. Is there any metaphysical barrier to simulating our brains on a computer?</p>
<p>At the level of genes + environment</p>
<p>Furthermore, consider simply introspecting. Words just come to you. How many of our decision are even conscious? This point is driven home by the libet experiments, which show researchers can predict your actions before you&rsquo;re even consciously aware of it.</p>
<p>Indeterminism objection, is irrelevant. Dice isn&rsquo;t a decision. The problem wasn&rsquo;t determinism exactly, it&rsquo;s that our decisions are law-like at all.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re ready to see, that though the sciences provided a powerful validation of this picture, our central conclusion can be arrived at a-priori. Two options: determinism and indeterminism. We happen to have good reason to think our world evolves deterministically, but even if we didn&rsquo;t, this simple binary would still apply. Neither is good for human freedom. What other options are there? Even if we introduce a magic substance. The same problem applies. The problem for human freedom is essentially a logical matter. Even in an invented world. Not only does freedom not exist in our world, it&rsquo;s impossible to conieve of a world where we would be free.</p>
<h3 id="positions">Positions</h3>
<p>This image of ourselves as a kind of mechanical device may seem difficult to reconcile with our intuitive conception of ourselves as free agents. If the decisions you&rsquo;ll make have been fixed since the big bang and the factors that influence your decisions are beyond your control one might wonder what role is left for human decision making. This tension has led some philosophers to accept incompatibilism - the view that free will and determinism are incompatible. While some incompatibilists have maintained the existence of free will and concluded from this that determinism must be <em>false</em>, the vast majority have accepted determinism and concluded that there&rsquo;s no free will. On the other hand there are compatibilists, who don&rsquo;t think determinism is a threat to free will, and so may accept both.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a useful table that re-iterates these positions.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>

<th>Incompatibilism</th>

<td>Yes free will (soft determinism)</td>
<td>No free will (hard determinism)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reject Determinism</td>
<td>-</td>
<td>Yes free will (libertarianism)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I hope I&rsquo;ve painted the arguments for determinism in a sufficiently compelling light, and I hope you feel the intuitive pull of why it poses a threat to human freedom, though we&rsquo;ll eventually see how the entire narrative above is laden with subtle confusions. Since I&rsquo;ve never heard an argument for libertarianism that I thought was remotely compelling, we&rsquo;re going to cross it off for now and assume that determinism is correct as well. Given these assumptions I&rsquo;ll be able to use compatibilism interchangably with soft determinism, and incompatibilism interchangably with hard determinism. But before wading into the compatibilism/incompatibilism debate, we&rsquo;re going to take a step back to examine how to reason about this debate.</p>
<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>
<p>Like many perennial problems in philosophy, the issue of free will is one where the meanings of the key terms is a central point of contention. While the above picture is <em>prima facie</em> to threatning to human freedom, we&rsquo;d like to decide this more rigourously, which will require a precise definition of all the relevant terms. Of course the outcome of this analysis will depend on what definitions we use. To some extent this is a semantic issue - some free will canidates are incompatible with determinism and therefore unreal, and other weaker free will canidates are compatible with determinism and real, and that&rsquo;s all that can be said. But surely how people normally conceptialize their own freedom matters?</p>
<p>Can we write down a definition of free will as most people understand it? Doing this is surprisingly difficult. Many have tried, but there&rsquo;s no concensus around one definition, or even that there <em>is</em> a coherent concept of freedom to give a definition of. Here&rsquo;s a few canidates.</p>
<ul>
<li>The power of acting without the constraint of necessity or fate</li>
<li>The ability to act at one&rsquo;s own discretion</li>
<li>The ability to do otherwise</li>
<li>The capacity or ability to choose between different possible courses of action unimpeded</li>
<li>The power to make decisions or perform actions idependently of any prior event or state of the universe</li>
<li>The ability to act and make choices independant of any outside influence</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these definitions (like 1 and 2) are taken to be incompatible with determinism. Some definitions (like 3 and 4) are taken to compatible with determinism. Some are disputed. Hard determinists will likely have one of the first definitions in mind, and soft determinists will likely have one of the latter ones. Given that they may concieve of the debate in different ways, is there any reason to say one of them is <em>right</em> and the other <em>wrong</em>? Or is this only an issue of semantics?</p>
<p>I’d like to suggest a general strategy for resolving disagreements about definitions, but first we need to examine the concept of a definition itself. Most importantly, there’s a distinction between <em>intensional</em> and <em>extensional</em> definitions. An intensional definition specifies the meaning of a term using necessary and sufficient conditions, or in other words, listing the properties an object needs to have in order to be counted as a referent of the term. For example, you might say that to be a “bachelor” is to be “unmarried” and a “man”. This is in contrast to the extensional definition, which is given using a list of all the objects that satisfy the definition. So an extensional definition of a bachelor would be the list “Bob”, “Ike”, “Jim” and all the other bachelors. Another way to put this is that the intension of a term gives it&rsquo;s <em>meaning</em>, while the extension of a term gives its <em>referant</em>.</p>
<h3 id="aristotelian-physics">Aristotelian Physics</h3>
<p>(maybe change this example to not introduce the chemist until the end)</p>
<p>Let’s apply this framework to help us understand a simple disagreement. This may seem like a tangent but I promise it it provides a powerful analogy to the free will debate and it will help us clarify the issue significantly. Imagine that an Aristotelian physicist meets with a modern-day chemist to debate the nature of water. The former believes that water is one of the four elements that compose the terrestrial sphere…</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>They both believe water is liquid, and blue, and drinkble, but one says water is H2O and the other says it&rsquo;s a fundemental element of nature. They agree on all the instances of water - that it&rsquo;s in the cup, that it&rsquo;s in the lake and ocean, etc. So they agree about the <em>extension</em> of water but they disagree about the <em>intension</em> of water.  Another way of saying this is that they agree on the <em>referent</em> of water, but just not what water <em>is</em>.</p>
<p>This shows that the reference of a term can systematically deviate from the underlying concept. I don&rsquo;t claim to provide a full theory of reference here, but&hellip;</p>
<p>How would verify/analyze claims? One tempting account is to give a definition in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions, and to look for something that satisfies that concept. While this approach is natural, it is clearly wrong. If this was the right way to analyze the claims, then it would be <em>false</em>, that water is blue, that water is a liquid, and so on, because there does not exist a fundemental element with these properties. The right way to analyze the claim is instead to look at the referent of the claim, or the extension of the term.</p>
<p>Now if the aristotelian does an experiment and learns that water is <em>H2O</em>, how should they revise their beliefs? They need only change their belief about the <em>intension</em> of water. They should not then conclude that water doesn&rsquo;t exist, or that it&rsquo;s not blue, so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So modern chemistry should lead us to revise our concept of water. We should not conclude water doesn&rsquo;t exist, or that our other beliefs about it were false. This is because in deciding if something is real what matters is the <em>referent</em> of the term.</p>
<p>So in deciding whether, for the Aristotelian physicist, water is real and their various beliefs about wate rare true, what matters is the referant of the term. Not whether their concept is satisfied by anything in the world.</p>
<p>(could cache all this out in terms of predicate logic)
(predicate logic of extensions and definitions)</p>
<p>Note that this doesn&rsquo;t mean concepts are always real. Take the case of the luminous ether, or race. Neither of these concepts has a referrant. It is false that the either has X, Y, Z properties, there is no fundemental distinction between groups&hellip; etc. Ether doesn&rsquo;t refer to anything. Unicorn doesn&rsquo;t refer to anything (in the world). So in deciding if something is real, what matters is whether our usage refers to something.</p>
<h3 id="free-will">Free Will</h3>
<p>I will argue that the situation with the aristotelian chemist is close analogue of the free will debate, except instead of the problematic concept being a pre-scientific theory of nature, it&rsquo;s a pre-scientific theory of mind – that is, the commonsense but false way that people concieve of their own minds, the minds of others, and how these minds relate to the world.</p>
<p>When deciding if a concept like freedom is real, it’s tempting to start with an intensional, and to look for anything in the world that satisfies the specified conditions. The case of the Aristotelian physicist shows that this is not always the right strategy, and that in deciding whether free will is <em>real</em>, we should look at the <em>referent</em> of the term to see if it refers to something. We should look to see if our use of the term refers to a real distinction - free and unfree actions.</p>
<h2 id="folk-psychology">Folk Psychology</h2>
<h3 id="folk-psychology-1">Folk Psychology</h3>
<p>When I say that part of the problem is a pre-scientific theory of mind, I&rsquo;m referring to what psychologists and philosophers have often called &ldquo;folk psychology&rdquo; - that is, the natural way people think about how the minds of themselves and others work and relate to the world. Here&rsquo;s a rough sketch of how this theory works.</p>
<p>First, there&rsquo;s a simple distinction between the <em>self</em> and the <em>external</em> world. The self has an internal world that is populated with thoughts, feelings, and sensations, and the external world is filled with objects and agents. The self has direct access to the thoughts that arise in the conscious mind, and you have <em>indirect</em> access to the external world, which is mediated by your senses.</p>
<p>These objects may be classified according to their properties, and one of the most important classes is that of agents.
Agents have special capacities, like that of the will, and special powers, like the ability to make decisions.</p>
<p>Same logic of property attribution can be extended to model agents as well. Though we know through science that the brain is a messy collection of neurons that&rsquo;s difficult to characterize, it turns out that people&rsquo;s mental states can be fairly effectively modelled using the language of propositional attitudes.</p>
<p>The behavior of agents have various propositional attitudes, like the states of belief, desire, and intention, attitudes which may also apply to the self.</p>
<p>Example of the intention to go to the grocery store. Way more efficient than simulating their brain. For evolutionary reasons many animals have minds that can also be modelled in this way.</p>
<p>It is very, <em>very</em> important to note that this is an account of how we naturally <em>represent</em> our own minds. It doesn&rsquo;t follow from the fact that our minds naturally concieve of themselves in this way that our minds actually do function this way. There may be a disconnect between how our minds work and how we naturally think our minds work.</p>
<p>Unlikely to find a list of beliefs in a brain. Unlikely to be able to give a precise definition of what a belief is. If someone honestly asserts they belive something but consistently act to the contrary, do the believe it? Not a fact of the matter. In these edge cases the folk story breaks down.</p>
<p>For example, the distinction between first and third person objects, is a fundemental <em>conceptual</em> distinctoin, not a fundemental ontological category. Our minds categorize the world into the subjective, objective, etc. It does not follow that the world actually is this way. A failure to recognize that this division is a matter of how we represent the world, has led to many confusions in the history of philosophy. Has led to the reification of the mental as a fundamental ontological category, like the idealists who debate whether the composition of the world is mental or not.</p>
<h3 id="wrong">Wrong</h3>
<p>The story I&rsquo;ve told above has a lot of common sense appeal, and the errors in the narrative may be difficult to see at first. Despite the usefullness for modelling and predicting human behavior, most of the propositions of folk psychology are wrong in subtle ways.</p>
<p>There isn’t a fundamental division between self and the external world. There is just the world. Science has given us good reason to think our minds are our brains, and that are brains are natural objects like any other - materially contiguous in space with all the other matter in the universe. There may be a fundemental distinction in how we <em>concieve</em> of the self and world, and we might do that for good <em>reason</em>, but that&rsquo;s a matter of representation (or a category of thought), not a matter of how the world actually is. The reification of these conceptual categories as ontological ones has led to many confusions in the history of philosophy, like idealism and substance dualism, and the difficulty of seeing beyond this perspective has led to meaningless debates about topics like whether the world is fundamentally physical or mental. Many of these distinctions are so foundational to how we think, that it can be difficult to see outside of them or how they might lead us astray, which they often do.</p>
<p>We aren&rsquo;t outside of the world, intervening in it. We&rsquo;re a part of the world.</p>
<ul>
<li>Similarly this is how we model our own minds, and it may not correspond to how our minds actually function</li>
<li>Minds are a complex messy collection of neural nets. There’s unlikely to be a list of “beliefs” or “desires” or “intentions” to be found anywhere, etc</li>
<li>May not be a brain state that corresponds to a propositional attitude. We model their behavior by ascribing this property because it predicts their behavior. Intention is a good example</li>
</ul>
<p>Note, that I&rsquo;m not saying there isn&rsquo;t <em>any</em> distinction between the self and the world - clearly there are numerous differences between a bunch of particles grouped into a rock and a bunch of particles grouped into a human being.  I&rsquo;m only saying that this distinction isn&rsquo;t <em>fundemental</em> or <em>categorical</em>.</p>
<p>I’m also not arguing that our folk theory of mind should be thrown out (a la the Churchlands). Similar to how Newtonian mechanics is a great approximation of the dynamics of material objects, the folk theory of mind is actually a pretty good way to model our minds most of the time. It’s actually quite amazing how effectively a list of propositional attitudes can be used to model/predict the behavior of a complex brain consisting of 100 billion neurons. That being said, this theory does gloss over many subtleties of our psychology, and the free will debate is one where these subtleties matter.</p>
<p>The aspect of our theory of mind we’re concern about here is our theory of the will, which is capable of motivating actions</p>
<h3 id="decisions">Decisions</h3>
<ul>
<li>One aspect of this folk theory is our theory of the will</li>
<li>The will is capable of causing actions through the act of willing</li>
<li>One of these propositional attitudes is that of willing</li>
<li>If someone is willing something, then they will act in a way so as to bring about that proposition</li>
<li>Furthermore, we make the distinction between acts that are willed freely, and those that aren’t</li>
</ul>
<p>In our understanding of decision-making, a central element lies in our concept of the will. The will, as we conceive it, possesses the power to initiate actions through the act of volition. Within the realm of our cognitive framework, one pivotal propositional attitude is the act of willing itself. When an individual is in a state of willing, it follows that they will engage in actions aimed at realizing the desired proposition.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is crucial to draw a distinction between actions that stem from the exercise of free will and those that do not. This differentiation plays a significant role in our conceptualization of human agency and choice.</p>

<h3 id="essense-of-the-debate-1">Essense of the debate 1</h3>
<ul>
<li>So this is the essence of the debate</li>
<li>We have a folk psychological theory of how the mind works</li>
<li>With the corresponding concept of human freedom</li>
<li>Various aspects of this theory are incompatible with various facts of science</li>
<li>Science is presenting us with an orthogonal theory of how the mind works</li>
<li>It’s unclear if the folk theory can be reduced to the neuroscientific one</li>
<li>That is, it&rsquo;s unclear if our ordinary conception of freedom has a place in a scientific understanding of our mind</li>
<li>Several positions
<ul>
<li>Determinism, compatibilism, etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The crux of the ongoing debate regarding human freedom and the nature of the mind revolves around the juxtaposition of our folk psychological theory and scientific accounts of cognition. The folk psychological perspective provides us with an intuitive and traditional understanding of mental processes and assumes a corresponding notion of human freedom. However, various tenets of this lay theory often find themselves at odds with empirical evidence and theories derived from scientific inquiry.</p>
<p>Science, in its quest for understanding, introduces a theory of the mind that is fundamentally orthogonal to folk psychology. It constructs a narrative based on neurological and cognitive processes, challenging the layperson&rsquo;s conceptualization of autonomy and decision-making. This presents a philosophical conundrum: can the folk psychological narrative of the mind, with its inherent concept of freedom, be reconciled with or reduced to the neuroscientific model? The integration of our ordinary sense of free will within the framework of a scientifically informed view of the mind remains an open question.</p>
<h2 id="mixing-scince-and-folk-psychology">Mixing scince and folk psychology</h2>
<p>The confusions start to set in when we mix this naive theory of how our minds work with other facts established by science. We&rsquo;ll see how these confusions are the basis of the intuitive incompatibility between free will and determinism.</p>
<p>The manifest image is hard to throw off. These problemeatic concepts are fundemental to our cognition.</p>
<h3 id="confusion-1-fatalism">Confusion 1: Fatalism</h3>
<p>Comes from thinking of mind as separate entities that intervene in the external world.</p>
<ul>
<li>This way of thinking is fundemental to causal reasoning, which is about intervention</li>
<li>What happens when you combine the folk theory of mind with the fact of determinism? You get fatalism.</li>
<li>This confusion comes from imagining your mind as somehow separate from the world, and interevening in it</li>
<li>If world is causally closed, your decisions don&rsquo;t matter. You can&rsquo;t change anything.</li>
<li>Mind is separate from the world, if the world is causally closed, your decisions don’t matter</li>
<li>No one doubts determinism in the context of science, or on the basis of science. They only doubt it after it seems to conflict with their experience.</li>
<li>The fact that the truth/falsity of determinism has been central to the free will debate shows the confusion</li>
<li>Give examples of confused redditors</li>
</ul>
<p>The notion of fatalism often arises from a confusion embedded in how we conceptualize the mind. This confusion is the result of viewing the mind as a distinct entity that exerts influence upon the external world. Such a perspective is deeply ingrained in our fundamental understanding of causal reasoning, which inherently involves the concept of intervention. When people meld this folk theory of the mind with the principle of determinism—the idea that all events, including moral choices, are determined by previously existing causes—they land on the fatalistic view that our choices are predetermined and, hence, irrelevant.</p>
<p>This fatalistic outlook is borne from the presumption that the mind operates independently from the causal network of the world. Under such a presumption, if one accepts the world as causally complete, it appears to leave no room for human intervention or decision-making. It suggests a universe where our decisions are rendered moot because if everything is predestined, the belief goes, then nothing we decide can alter the predetermined course.</p>
<p>In scientific contexts, the principle of determinism is rarely disputed. The doubts tend to arise not from scientific evidence but from a sense of conflict with personal experience—how can everything be predetermined if we feel as though we are making choices? This discord underscores the role that the debate over the truth or falsity of determinism plays in discussions about free will, revealing the extent of the confusion surrounding this topic.</p>
<p>For example, one might find numerous instances on forums like Reddit where individuals express consternation over the implications of determinism. Some may argue that if determinism is true, then efforts at personal growth or striving for goals are futile. Others might express a sense of resignation or apathy towards decision-making and morality, suggesting that if our paths are already set, our perceived choices are nothing more than illusions. These are manifestations of the confusion that arises when our intuitive understanding of the mind as a separate force clashes with the deterministic nature of the universe as posited by science.</p>
<h3 id="confusion-2-decisions-fixed-by-past-causes">Confusion 2: Decisions fixed by past causes</h3>
<p>Comes from the humonculous fallacy. From thinking I am somehow separate from my brain.</p>
<ul>
<li>Okay. So we need to fix our theory of mind a bit. Our minds are part of the world.</li>
<li>Decisions have been fixed since the big bang</li>
<li>People somehow think physics <em>forces</em> you to make a decision, somehow.</li>
<li>Mindless particles somehow make you do certain things.</li>
<li>So our actions <em>are</em> caused by reasons. It&rsquo;s just that our reasoning is another physical process.</li>
<li>Give examples of confused redditors, professors, Sapolsky</li>
<li>Even the language of the past &ldquo;influencing&rdquo; our decisions shows this confusion</li>
</ul>
<p>The second confusion in our understanding of free will and determinism arises from what is known as the homunculus fallacy—the mistaken notion that &ldquo;I&rdquo; am something separate from my brain, an inner self that directs the physical body. To move past this fallacy, it&rsquo;s essential to revise our theory of mind to acknowledge that our minds are not detached observers but integral components of the physical world.</p>
<p>Embedded in this revision is the deterministic view that the outcomes of all decisions have been set in motion since the beginning of the universe, with the events of the Big Bang leading to a causal chain that ultimately culminates in the present. This perspective often leads to the misconception that physics &ldquo;forces&rdquo; decisions upon us as though we are passive receivers of external forces, with our actions determined by mindless particles rather than autonomous choices.</p>
<p>However, this is a misunderstanding of how decision-making operates. Our actions are indeed caused by reasons, but it&rsquo;s crucial to recognize that our reasoning process itself is another physical process, deeply integrated within the intricate workings of the brain. Examples of this confusion can be found not only among casual conversationalists on platforms like Reddit but also among academics and educators. Robert Sapolsky, for example, has discussed how our understanding of biology and neuroscience challenges traditional notions of free will, often leading to misinterpretations about human behavior being merely the output of biochemical processes.</p>
<p>Even the way we commonly speak about the past &ldquo;influencing&rdquo; our decisions can reflect this confusion. It&rsquo;s not that the past exerts a mystical influence over us, but rather that the past is part of a continuous chain of cause and effect that encompasses both physical and mental events. When people discuss how their childhood or previous experiences influence their choices, they&rsquo;re inadvertently echoing this confusion without recognizing that these influences are part of the broader tapestry of causality that includes the physical brain and its processes.</p>
<h3 id="confusion-3-couldnt-do-otherwise">Confusion 3: Couldn&rsquo;t do otherwise</h3>
<ul>
<li>&lt;maybe the same as confusion 2&gt;</li>
<li>Rewind time, you would always make the same decision, so you couldn&rsquo;t do otherwise.</li>
<li>This is not correct, it&rsquo;s actually that you <em>wouldn&rsquo;t</em> do otherwise.</li>
<li>Couldn&rsquo;t meants <em>if</em> you had chosen, then you would do that thing</li>
<li>Wouldn&rsquo;t means you wouldn&rsquo;t ever choose</li>
<li>If you wouldn&rsquo;t, does this mean you are somehow constrained or forced by your environment?</li>
<li>In fact, if you failed to choose it, if it was random, <em>that</em> would be a threat to your freedom</li>
<li>You choose ice cream because you really prefer one. Of course you would always choose it. If you didn&rsquo;t, or made the decision on the basis of something else other than your preferences, <em>that</em> would be a threat to your freedom</li>
<li>If you chose at gunpoint, you&rsquo;re unfree. This is because you aren&rsquo;t aligning your decisions and desires.</li>
<li>At gunpoint, you can no longer choose to live and eat preferred ice cream. You are one optoin less free.</li>
<li>So you never <em>would</em> choose. Even though you certainly <em>could</em> choose.</li>
<li>Give examples of confused redditors, professors, Sapolsky</li>
<li>Note that it&rsquo;s precesely <em>because</em> our reasons determine our actions, that we <em>wouldn&rsquo;t</em> do otherwise</li>
<li>And it&rsquo;s precisely <em>because</em> our reasons determine our actions, that we <em>could</em> do otherwise if we had different reasons</li>
</ul>
<p>The third confusion under scrutiny is the belief that in a deterministic framework, one &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t do otherwise.&rdquo; This confusion may seem similar to the second, yet it warrants its own analysis. The common argument is that if we were to replay events, an individual would invariably make the same decision, implying an absence of alternative possibilities. However, this conclusion is mistaken. The reality is not that one &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t&rdquo; but rather that one &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t&rdquo; do otherwise. The term &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t&rdquo; suggests a hypothetical: if you had decided to choose differently, then that different choice would have been made. In contrast, &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t&rdquo; indicates a definitive stance, affirming that you would never make a different choice, not because of incapacity, but due to consistent preferences or reasons.</p>
<p>Does this steadfastness of decision imply that one is constrained or forced by their environment? Not necessarily. If decisions were random or not rooted in the individual&rsquo;s reasons, then the unpredictability of choice would pose a real threat to the concept of freedom. To illustrate, when one chooses their favorite flavor of ice cream, they do so out of preference. Repeatedly selecting the same flavor underscores that given the same circumstances, one&rsquo;s preferences remain the same, hence the outcome is the same. A divergence from this pattern—if one were to choose differently without a change in preference—would suggest a disconnect between desire and decision, which is the real encroachment on freedom.</p>
<p>The situation changes under coercion, such as choosing at gunpoint. Here, the choice made is not a true reflection of one&rsquo;s desires, thus one is not free. Coercion strips away the freedom to act according to one&rsquo;s preferences, reducing the number of options one is free to choose from. Despite the coercive situation, it remains true that one &ldquo;could&rdquo; choose differently in principle, but given the circumstances, they never &ldquo;would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In debates on platforms such as Reddit, and even among academics, including Sapolsky, one may find examples of this confusion. The conversation often overlooks the distinction between the capacity to do otherwise (&ldquo;could&rdquo;) and the predictable outcome based on consistent reasons (&ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t&rdquo;). It is essential to note that it is precisely because our actions are determined by our reasons that we &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t&rdquo; do otherwise under the same conditions. And conversely, it is for the same reason—being determined by reasons—that we &ldquo;could&rdquo; do otherwise if our reasons were to change.</p>
<h3 id="confusion-4-">Confusion 4: ???</h3>
<ul>
<li>Would be nice to have a 4th confusion.</li>
<li>Maybe emergence related? Mindless atoms detemining decisions? Dawkins quite about no good, no evil, only&hellip; Or a quote from Alex that hard-nosed eliminativist.</li>
<li>Comment on Sapolsky wondering how there must be one neuron that acts independently of prior determining causes, forgets that the past events don’t fully determine it. What determines it is the combination of past events and its nature. Similarly our reasons our <em>in our nature</em>.</li>
<li>Comment on people saying you must &ldquo;act like free will exists&rdquo;</li>
<li>Comment on people saying the &ldquo;experience of freedom is real&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="reconciling-the-scientific-and-the-manifest-image">Reconciling the scientific and the manifest image</h2>
<h3 id="a-theory-of-decisions">A theory of decisions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Matter of deliboration</li>
<li>A physical process like any other</li>
<li>Same way a computer has certain processes</li>
<li>We should revise our theory of decisions because of referent</li>
</ul>
<p>A robust theory of decisions necessitates an understanding of decision-making as a matter of deliberation, which itself is a physical process akin to any other that occurs in the natural world. This process is not unlike the operational sequences found within a computer, where specific inputs and states lead to predictable outcomes based on the architecture and programming of the system. Just as a computer processes information and generates responses based on its design and the data it receives, so too does the human brain take in information, weigh it against a backdrop of prior knowledge, preferences, and reasoning, and produce what we term a decision.</p>
<p>Therefore, it becomes imperative that we reexamine and possibly revise our theory of decisions to incorporate this understanding. The concept of &lsquo;referent&rsquo; is crucial in this context—it suggests that our decisions refer back to, or are contingent upon, a complex interplay of physical processes within our neural architecture, just as a computer&rsquo;s operations refer back to its coding and hardware capabilities. Recognizing decisions as outcomes of such physical processes may challenge traditional notions of autonomy and free will, but it also aligns our theory of decision-making with a more scientifically grounded view of human behavior.</p>
<h3 id="a-theory-of-freedom">A theory of freedom</h3>
<ul>
<li>If naturalism is taken all the way.</li>
<li>Our decisions do matter.</li>
<li>They are physical process just like any other, but they do cause future events.</li>
<li>Our desires are essential part of determining the future, just like the big bang was.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s true that <em>who we are</em> was formed by are past
<ul>
<li>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we don&rsquo;t make decisions</li>
<li>It doesn&rsquo;t mean our decision are less free</li>
<li>It doesn&rsquo;t mean our <em>reasons</em> don&rsquo;t determine our actions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We should revise our theory of decisions because of referrent</li>
</ul>
<p>Does this refer to a real distinction in the world? Well consider the following cases: something, something, something.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So on this basis I&rsquo;ve accepted compatibilism and concluded that free will does exist. Perhaps we need to revise how we concieve of our own minds, but science has already made us do this for every other pre-scientific concept. I&rsquo;m somewhat skeptical, that this new concept of freedom will support a robust conception of moral responsibility, for example, though I&rsquo;m not sure that the original concept does either.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve attempted to show that many of the intuitions that drive the common view that free will and determinism are incompatible come from a failure to replace our pre-scientific theory of mind with a naturalist one. I find this somewhat ironic because the hard determinists often think of themselves as the ones who the most committed to science, while I&rsquo;m arguing many of them are unknowingly seeing this issue through the lens of a prescientific theory of mind.</p>
<p>The fact that determinism has been so central to the free will debate tells us less about free will and more about the stranglehold our intuitive psychology and innate concepts has over us.</p>
