<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Distinction between what you <em>say</em>, and what you <em>mean</em>.</p>
<p>Set of related questions</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the meaning of this sentence?</li>
<li>What does he/she mean by this sentence?</li>
</ul>
<p>Semantic meaning vs foundational meaning (plato stanfod theoies of meaning)</p>
<h3 id="refrence-vs-meaning">Refrence vs Meaning</h3>
<p>A theory of reference undertdetermines a theory of meaning, as shown with the following example:</p>
<p>(5)	All cordates are cordates.
(6)	All cordates are renates.</p>
<p>These mean different things. Furthermore, these examples coud differ in their truth value.</p>
<p>(7)	John believes that all cordates are cordates.
(8)	John believes that all cordates are renates.</p>
<h3 id="propositions">Propositions</h3>
<p>There are many kinds of sentences. Some express attitudes. Declarative sentences express propositions.</p>
<p>Sentences in two different languages express he same proposition. One can&rsquo;t be true and the other false.</p>
<p>What kinds of things are propositions? They&rsquo;re abstract objects like numbers, functions, etc. They encode a kind of structure, as defined by set theory.</p>
<p>Some nonsense sentences don&rsquo;t express any propositions.</p>
<h3 id="content-and-reference">Content and Reference</h3>
<p>With sentences, the relationship between content and reference amounts to the question of the relationship between the poposition a sentence expresses and he sentence&rsquo;s tuth value.</p>
<p>Sentences can express different propositions while having the same truth value.</p>
<p>Sentences can&rsquo;t express the same proposition while having different truth values.</p>
<p>If two people believe the same thing, one can&rsquo;t be right and the other wrong.</p>
<p>Individual words are insufficient to determine meaning. The organizing rules matter. It can&rsquo;t just be about common word usage or definitions.</p>
<p>Characters ar functions from contexts to contents.</p>
<p>Expessions are associated with characters, which are functions from contexts to contents. Contents determine a reference.</p>
<p>So what sort of things are contents?</p>
<p>Perhaps contens aae functions from cicumstances of evaluation to a reference? The idea is that the meaning of an expression is not what the expression stands for in the relevant circumstance, but rather a rule which tells you what the expression would stand for if the world were a certain way. So, on this view, the content of an expression like “the tallest man in the world” is not simply the man who happens to be tallest, but rather a function from ways the world might be to men—namely, that function which, for any way the world might be, returns as a referent the tallest man in that world (if there is one, and nothing otherwise). This fits nicely with the intuitive idea that to understand such an expression one needn’t know what the expression actually refers to—after all, one can understand “the tallest man” without knowing who the tallest man is—but must know how to tell what the expression would refer to, given certain information about the world (namely, the heights of all the men in it).</p>
<p>These functiosn are called intensions.</p>
<h3 id="russellian-semantics">Russellian Semantics</h3>
<p>Some people think propositions are structured, meaning that they have constituents which include the meaning of the expessions which make up the sentence expressing the relevant proposition.</p>
<p>Russelians may claim that two sentences with the same intension can differ in meaning</p>
<p>What sorts of things are the constituents of propositions? The answer to this question given by a proponent of Russellian propositions is: objects, properties, relations, and functions. Most Russellians also endorse a particular view about the contents of proper names which is known as Millianism: the view that the meaning of a simple proper name is the object (if any) for which it stands.</p>
<p>Problem for Millian-Russellian is that the following have a different meaning.</p>
<p>(19)	Lois believes that Clark Kent is Clark Kent.
(20)	Lois believes that Clark Kent is Superman.</p>
<h3 id="fregean-semantics">Fregean Semantics</h3>
<p>Fregeans may claim hat two names tha refe to the same object can differ in meaning.</p>
<p>Fregeans, like Russellians, think of the proposition expressed by a sentence as a structured entity with constituents which are the contents of the expressions making up the sentence.</p>
<p>But Fregeans, unlike Russellians, do not think of these propositional constituents as the objects, properties, and relations for which these expressions stand; instead, Fregeans think of the contents as modes of presentation, or ways of thinking about, objects, properties, and relations. The standard term for these modes of presentation is sense.</p>
<p><em>Frege’s criterion of difference for senses</em>: Two sentences S and S* differ in sense if and only if some rational agent who understood both could, on reflection, judge that S is true without judging that S* is true.</p>
<h3 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h3>
<ul>
<li>Davidsonian semantics</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="foundational-theories-of-meaning">Foundational Theories of Meaning</h2>
<p>We now turn to our second sort of “theory of meaning”: foundational theories of meaning, which are attempts to specify the facts in virtue of which expressions of natural languages come to have the semantic properties that they have.</p>
<h3 id="mentalist-theories">Mentalist Theories</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gricean program</li>
<li>Meaning, belief and convention (secion 3.1.2)</li>
<li>Meanal repesentation-based theories (section 3.1.3)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="non-mentalist-theories">Non-Mentalist Theories</h3>
<ul>
<li>Causal origin</li>
<li>Truth maximization</li>
<li>Reference magnetism</li>
<li>Regularities in use</li>
<li>Social norms</li>
