The points of contention include not only the answer to the question itself, but also the meaning and nature of all the concepts presupposed by the question, and though it superficially takes the form of an empirical question about human psychology, it&amp;rsquo;s unclear if any experiment would resolve it, or even if empirical results are relevant evidence in principal.</description>
